I want to develop a fully responsive charity donation system using Flutter Web, optimized for mobile devices and future APK builds. The system includes a landing page with detailed information, images, testimonials, and a donation form with fields: name, mobile (used as a unique identifier), email, amount, purpose, address, street, city, pincode, document type (Aadhar Card or PAN Card), and document number. On clicking "Donate Now", Razorpay should be triggered with the entered amount, and upon successful payment, the system should check whether the mobile number exists in the databaseâ€”if not, create a user, then log the donation under that user ID. There is a user login page that verifies the phone number in the database, and if found, redirects to the user dashboard. The user dashboard contains a sidebar with options: Dashboard, Tax Detail Update, Donation History, and Sign Out. The dashboard displays donation statistics graphically; the tax detail section allows users to add or update Aadhar and PAN details; the donation history section presents a table listing all donation records with invoice download options for each and an Excel export for all records. The system includes a separate admin login page with fixed credentials (admin@example.com / admin123), which, upon validation, grants access to the admin dashboard. The admin dashboard has a sidebar with Dashboard, Donors, Donor Details, Reports, and Sign Out. The admin dashboard shows overall donation insights with date filters; the Donors section lists unique users by name and phone number, total donations, and transaction count, with a view button that opens a popup showing all donations (both successful and failed) in a table with date, amount, tax ID, name, email, and status; it also includes search and Excel export functionality. Donor Details displays all data submitted through the donation form, with date and time of donations, date range filtering, and search. Reports section provides graphical donation statistics. Both user and admin dashboards support secure logout. Please suggest the best Flutter packages for Razorpay integration, state management, responsive layout, charting, Excel export, and secure data handling; recommend a suitable backend (Firebase, Supabase, or others) for authentication, data storage, and role management; propose a clean database schema covering users, donations, documents, and transactions; provide guidance on route protection and access control for users and admins; and outline a maintainable and scalable folder structure for the project.
